**User agent**
A user agent is any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end user
interaction with Web content, or whose user interface is implemented using
Web technologies. e.g. Web Browsers

The user agent is the client in a client–server system. The HTTP User-Agent
header is intended to clearly identify the agent to the server. However, this
header can be omitted or spoofed, so some websites use other detection
methods.

**Post/Redirect/Get (Design pattern)**

(Solution: Just redirect the user to a different URI.

Flash messages are stored in a session-specific area, designed to hold
messages temporarily. Once a user views these messages, they are
automatically cleared from the session. This mechanism is particularly
effective in combination with page redirects, ensuring that messages are
displayed promptly on the subsequent page load.)

Lets the page to be shown after the form submitted to be reloaded, shared, or 
bookmarked without bad effects, such as submitting the form again another time.
i.e. Resubmits the Post request again.

Instead of responding with content, the server responds to a POST request by
redirecting the client to another location.

The PRG pattern cannot address every scenario of duplicate form submission.
For example, if a web user refreshes before the initial submission completes,
possibly because of server lag, a duplicate POST occurs in certain user agents.

If the user hits refresh, the browser warns them:
"Are you sure you want to resubmit the form?" If they click yes, the form
data is submitted again, potentially causing duplicate entries, database 
conflicts, or unnecessary processing.

The asyncHandler pattern comes from a combination of two fundamental software
design concepts: Higher-Order Functions (Functional) and the Decorator Pattern
(Object-oriented).

**Understanding the Foreign Key Relationship**
The Foreign Key is defined on the child table (copies) and
references the parent table (books).

Parent Table: books (contains the id of the title).

Child Table: copies (contains the book_id, which is the Foreign Key).

The rule enforced by this link is: A row cannot be inserted into the copies
table unless its book_id already exists as an id in the books table.

*Deleting a Row in copies*
To delete a row in the copies table, you only need to know the primary key
of that row, which would be the copy_id (or whatever primary key you defined
for the copies table).

**Restriction: Deleting a Row in books**
The Foreign Key relationship does create a restriction when you try
to delete a row in the parent table (books):

You cannot delete a book (title) if there are still existing copies
that reference it.

If you try to delete the entry for The Great Gatsby from the books table,
the database will throw an error if there are still rows in the copies
table that have a book_id pointing to it.

This prevents orphan records—copies that belong to a book title that no longer exists.

What to do when deleting a row in books:
1. Delete the associated rows in copies first:

2. Define a CASCADE action on the Foreign Key: This tells the database to
automatically delete the associated child rows in copies whenever the parent
row in books is deleted. This is done when you set up the table schema.

**CRIT: When you define a Foreign Key using the safest default, like ON**
DELETE RESTRICT (or if you don't specify any action, which often defaults
to this), the database strictly enforces referential integrity:

The database will prevent you from deleting a row (a book title)
from the parent table (books) if there are any referencing rows (copies)
in the child table (copies).

GOAT: "ON" SQL Keyword Data Integrity

CRIT:
A key concept in JavaScript: the difference between a const variable binding
and the mutability of the object it references.

The code is allowed because const only prevents you from reassigning the
variable itself, but it does not prevent you from modifying the contents
(properties) of the object the variable points to.

Think of book as a const signpost pointing to a specific house in memory.
( Like a pointer!! )
