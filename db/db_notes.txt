The MySQL Docker entrypoint executes the initialization scripts **sequentially by name order**.

When the MySQL container starts for the first time, its initialization script
processes all files found in the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` directory
(which you mounted your local `db/init` folder to) in **alphabetical
(lexicographical) order**.

### How Naming Ensures Order

You must use a numerical prefix in the filename to guarantee the execution
sequence:

1.  **`01_schema.sql`** is executed first. This is crucial because
you **must create the tables (the schema) before you can insert data into them**.
2.  **`02_data.sql`** is executed second. This script relies on the tables
having been created in the first step.
3.  Any other files, like `03_procedures.sql` (for stored procedures),
would be executed next, continuing the sequential flow.

By prefixing your files with numbers (`01_`, `02_`, etc.), you ensure the
database initialization process is reliable and repeatable every time a new
volume is created. 


The Primary Key is used constantly by the database for indexing
and establishing relationships (Foreign Keys).

Fixed Size: An INT is typically 4 bytes and is a fixed size. The database
can read, compare, and cache these small, uniform values extremely quickly.

Variable Size: An ISBN is a VARCHAR(17), which is a variable-length string
that is much larger (up to 17 bytes) and slower to process and compare.

Indexing Efficiency: When you link the books table to another table (like
loans), the Foreign Key in the loans table will use the Primary Key type.
If you use the INT ID, the loans table is small and efficient. If you use
the VARCHAR(17) ISBN, the loans table grows larger and slower for every
single loan record.

CRIT: Primary Keys should be stable and reliable throughout the record's life.

CRIT: Potential for Change: While ISBNs are usually stable, they can
occasionally change (e.g., when a book is re-released under a new format, or
if an administrative correction is needed). If the Primary Key changes, every
table referencing that book via a Foreign Key (e.g., thousands of entries
in the loans history) would need to be updated, which is costly and risky.

For IMAGE URL size use varchar(2048):
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/417142/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-url-in-different-browsers#417184

Edge: Edge permits a maximum URL length of 2083 characters, although the
path portion of the URL cannot exceed 2048 characters.

"The practice of programming is more than just writing code. Programmers must also assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves and others. At the same time, they must be concerned with issues like compatibility, robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications." "The Practice of Programming covers all these topics, and more. This book is full of practical advice and real-world examples in C, C++, Java, and a variety of special-purpose languages."--Jacket', -- Note: Storing a search link in the description field

The most extraordinary scientist of his time, a unique combination of dazzling intellect and touching simplicity, Feynman had a passion for physics that was merely the Nobel Prize-winning part of an immense love of life and everything it could offer. He was hugely irreverent and always completely honest - with himself, with his colleagues, and with nature. "People say to me, \'Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?\' No, I\'m not. I\'m just looking to find out more about the world, and if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law that explains everything, so be it. That would be very nice to discover. If it turns out it\'s like an onion with millions of layers, and we\'re sick and tired of looking at layers, then that\'s the way it is ... My interest in science is to simply find out more about the world, and the more I find out the better it is. I like to find out."',
